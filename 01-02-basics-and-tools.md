## Tools and Knowledge

I won't tell you which operating system you should use - there is an interesting discussion on
[hackernews](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3786674 "hackernews"). I'll leave the choice up to you - you're reading
this book to learn Padrino not to be preached at about operating systems.


To actually see a running Padrino app, you need a web browser of your choice.  For writing the application, you can
either use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or use a plain text editor.


Nowadays there are a bunch of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) out there:


- [RubyMine by JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/ "RubyMine") - commercial, available for all platforms
- [Aptana RadRails](http://www.aptana.com/products/radrails "Aptana RadRails") - free, available for all platforms


Here is a list of plain text editors which are a popular choice among Ruby developers:


- [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/ "Emacs") - free, available for all platforms.
- [Gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/ "Gedit") - free, available for Linux and Windows.
- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ "Notepad ++") - free, available only for Windows.
- [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com "SublimeText") - commercial, available for all platforms.
- [Textmate](http://macromates.com/ "Textmate") - commercial, available only for Mac.
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim") - free, available for all platforms.


All tools have their strengths and weaknesses. Try to find the software that works best for you. The main goal is that
you are comfortable because you will spend a lot of time with it.


**Ruby Knowledge**

For any non-Ruby people, I strongly advise you to check out one of these books and learn the basics of Ruby before
continuing here.


- [Programming Ruby](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9 "Programming Ruby") - the book on every
  Rubyists desk, a.k.a. the pickaxe book.
- [Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://www.scribd.com/doc/8545174/Whys-Poignant-Guide-to-Ruby "Poignant Guide To Ruby") -
  written by the nebulous programmer [why the lucky stiff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff "Stiff") in
  an entertaining and educational way.
- [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org "Learn Ruby the Hard Way") - available online with each
  chapter containing short practical exercises to help you learn.
- [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram "Learn to Program") - a general learning to program book for
  beginners which just happens to use Ruby.  It is published by Pragmatic Programmers but is also available to read
  online.


In this book, I assume readers having Ruby knowledge and will not be explaining every last detail. I will, however,
explain Padrino specific coding techniques and how to get most of your code covered by tests.
